                    <h2>Places</h2>
                    <p>There are many different locations in the wizarding world. Here are some of them.</p>

                    <h3>Hogwarts</h3>
                    <img src="images/Hogwarts.jpg" alt="Hogwarts">
                    <p>Hogwarts is the main location where a large portion of the series takes place. It's a wizarding school in Britian and where all the main character go to school. It's split into four houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin.</p>

                    <p>Diagon Alley is the first wizarding world location Harry visited. It's where students attending Hogwarts shop for their school supplies.</p>

                    <p>The Burrow is the home of the Weasley family. It's a special place to Harry, as the Weasleys treated him as a part of their family, unlike his aunt and uncle, who "raised" him.</p>

                    <h3>The Lovegood Home</h3>
